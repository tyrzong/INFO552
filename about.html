                <h2>About me</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            I am a dedicated master's student studying software engineering with a deep passion for creating software solutions 
                            that enhance people's lives. My goal is to develop applications and systems that streamline processes, automate tasks,
                             and ultimately make daily routines easier and more efficient. I am particularly intrigued by the intersection of 
                             automation and artificial intelligence, as I believe these fields have the potential to revolutionize various 
                             industries and improve overall quality of life.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            In addition to my software expertise, I have a keen interest in working with computer hardware to bring my 
                            ideas to life. From conceptualizing and designing physical prototypes to integrating them with software systems, 
                            I enjoy exploring the synergy between hardware and software development.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Outside of academia and my professional pursuits, I find joy in competitive activities. Playing spikeball and 
                            participating in melee tournaments provide me with an outlet to challenge myself, improve my skills, and embrace 
                            the thrill of healthy competition. It's immensely gratifying to witness my progress and growth as I strive to 
                            become the best version of myself both in the virtual and physical arenas.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            I am motivated by the opportunity to apply my technical knowledge, creativity, and problem-solving abilities
                             to contribute to the ever-evolving world of software engineering. I am constantly seeking new challenges, 
                             collaborating with like-minded individuals, and expanding my horizons to create innovative solutions that 
                             positively impact people's lives.
