                <h1>Current Status</h1>
                <p>Thanks to our wonderful contributors so far, we have found gas stations serving 93 octane in 46/50 states in the U.S. including: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisana, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming!</p>
                <p>We also have over 200 stations on the map in Canada! In British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec</p>
                <p>Thanks so much for sharing! Keep them coming.</p>

                <h2>Gas stations</h2>
                <p>We have reached out to many gas stations, and have heard back from them. The following refueling stations are independently owned franchises, and it's up to the owner if they will sell 93 octane:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>BP</li>
                <li>Citgo</li>
                <li>Shell</li>
                <li>Sunoco</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A representative for Cumberland Farms, with gas stations in Connecticut, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont, has reached out and said "All of our sites sell premium grade 93 octane except for the state of Maine. In Maine it is 91 octane."</p>
                <p>A representative for Rutter's, with gas stations in Pennsylvania, has reached out and said "All of our locations serve 93 octane fuel."</p>
                <p>A representative for QuikTrip in Georgia has reached out and said "They all offer 93 octane."</p>
                <p>The following stations do NOT serve 93 octane gasoline:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Kwik Trip (Recently they've been popping up in Wisconsin with 93 octane)</li>
                <li>Super America (MOST serve 92 octane, I have only found 1, in Chanhassen, MN that serves 93)</li>
                <li>Holiday Station Stores</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It's pretty easy to eliminate certain gas stations that don't sell 93 octane, but it's a whole different animal to find the ones that do as it is often up to the owner of the station. Once again, you and your friends can help us find and <a href="/index.html">map</a> them all. Please share the site!</p>

                <h2>WHAT DOES 93 OCTANE GAS DO?</h2>
                <p>The octane rating for gasoline has nothing to do with the amount of power locked inside of it. It relates to just how much a fuel can be compressed before igniting. The higher the number, the less likely it is to ignite under pressure.</p>
                <p>More aggressive engine management schemes can turn up the compression to a high level. Sports cars tend to require much higher octane gasoline to avoid knock. Gasoline is sprayed into a cylinder by a fuel injector and mixed with oxygen. It should remain in vapor form until it is time for the spark plug to light it up. This causes the explosion that drives the piston down to generate horsepower. The timing of this explosion is critical. Gas that ignites too early causes 'knock'. Knock reduces engine output and efficiency, and can damage an engine.</p>
                <p>You won't see a power or fuel efficiency increase by running 93 octane fuel in an engine that designed for Regular gas, unless you've got your car running an ECM tune for 93. Nor will doing so perform any extra 'cleaning' inside the motor.</p>
                <p>Running low octane fuel in an engine built for Premium can increase the risk of engine damage, and will impact performance.</p>
                <p>Find93.com recommends you follow the instructions in your owners manual regarding what kind of fuel to put in your gas tank. 91 or 92 octane is a decent substitute for people who live in California or remote areas where 93 octane gas cannot be found. Use our <a href="/index.html">map above</a> to locate a 93 octane gas station near you.</p>

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Find93.com was founded by me, <a href="http://paulkragthorpe.com/">Paul Kragthorpe</a>, in 2015. I also own and operate <a href="https://findfhc.com/">FindFHC.com, a Full Hookup Campground Locator</a>.</p>
                <p>I purchased a 2015 Scion FR-S in January and quickly noticed the owners manual recommended I put premium 93 octane gas in my tank.</p>
                <img src="https://find93.com/images/frs.jpg" alt="2015 Scion FR-S 93 Octane">
                <p>That's my boy and my car =)</p>
                <p>After several searches on Google I found there wasn't an easy way to tell which gas stations out there serve 93 octane gasoline! So I took it upon myself to create one. See a need fill a need, right?</p>
                <p>That's how it all started. Now I know there are others out there who would like to find the best gas for their cars that they can. I'm guessing it's the same type of person who would gladly share their knowledge with the rest of the world as well. So let's all work together to seek out and find 93 octane gas stations!</p>

                <h2>Why</h2>
                <p>After doing some usability testing, it's clear that people don't quite know why there is a need for this site. After all, we all have Google Maps or some other map app on our phones that can find gas stations for us. So why build this site?</p>
                <p>The answer is simple, there is no app out there or mapping application that displays what octane gasoline each gas station serves. So it's impossible to just open a map and type in "93 octane gas close to me" and find a station. Those of us that have cars that require or recommend 93 octane have a difficult time finding a station that serves it. So, I built this site to make it easy to locate them.</p>
                <p>That's it. That's the whole reason. You can keep on using your maps on your phone to find your gas stations, but to find a 93 octane gas station near you, come to find93.com!</p>

                <h2>App</h2>
                <p>We don't have an app...yet. Of course that's one of the first things I thought of doing when I made the site. But it turns out it costs a lot of money to make the app that I want to make for this site. So there is none yet.</p>
                <p>I had an app developer who backed out. If you know of an app developer interested in helping, have them reach out!</p>
